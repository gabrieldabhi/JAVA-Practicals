Alphabet War Game: This game is a playful battle between letters, divided into two teamsâ€”left-side and right-side letters. Each letter is assigned a strength for both sides. The game first asks the user if they want to play with default strengths or assign new ones. Next, the user is prompted to choose whether they want to play a single turn or two turns (one for the left side and one for the right side). After the inputs, the program calculates the strength for both sides and declares whether the left or right side wins. Finally, the game asks if the user wants to play another round.
