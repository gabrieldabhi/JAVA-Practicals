Credit Card Validator: The program prompts the user to input a credit card number, which must be between 8 and 9 digits. It then verifies the card number through a series of steps. A switch-case structure wasn't used in this code because switch-case is generally suitable for handling multiple discrete conditions or values. In this case, the validation process is sequential, with each step (from Step a to Step f) relying on the outcome of the previous one. Since there are no distinct conditions or cases to handle at each step, a linear control flow, such as if-else statements or method calls, is more appropriate.
