Share Trader: This program calculates the maximum profit from two stock buy-sell transactions. It uses variables buy1, sell1, buy2, and sell2 to store the buy and sell prices for both transactions. The maxprofit variable tracks the highest profit. It loops through all possible buy-sell combinations, ensuring the first transaction (buy1 and sell1) happens before the second (buy2 and sell2). After computing the profit for each valid combination, the program outputs the maximum profit along with the respective buy and sell prices.
