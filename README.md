Credit Card Validator: The program prompts the user to input a credit card number, which must be between 8 and 9 digits. It then verifies the card number through a series of steps. A switch-case structure wasn't used in this code because switch-case is generally suitable for handling multiple discrete conditions or values. In this case, the validation process is sequential, with each step (from Step a to Step f) relying on the outcome of the previous one. Since there are no distinct conditions or cases to handle at each step, a linear control flow, such as if-else statements or method calls, is more appropriate.

Alphabet War Game: This game is a playful battle between letters, divided into two teamsâ€”left-side and right-side letters. Each letter is assigned a strength for both sides. The game first asks the user if they want to play with default strengths or assign new ones. Next, the user is prompted to choose whether they want to play a single turn or two turns (one for the left side and one for the right side). After the inputs, the program calculates the strength for both sides and declares whether the left or right side wins. Finally, the game asks if the user wants to play another round.

Top K Frequency Numbers: This program takes an array as input and returns the top K numbers based on their frequency of occurrence, as specified by the user. If two numbers have the same frequency, the program gives priority to the larger number. It utilizes static methods and static variables to perform its operations.
